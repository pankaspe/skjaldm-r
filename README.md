# Skjaldm√¶r boilerplate for Svelte Kit

Everything you need to build a Svelte project + supabase + tailwind, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Initial settings

Register on supabase and create project, just copy url & key from your project to .env file in root of directory.
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

create supabase account

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
